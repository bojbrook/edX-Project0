    <h1>Bowen Brooks</h1>
    <p>Iâ€™m a recent college graduate from the University of California Santa Cruz where I majored in Computer Engineering with an emphasis in System and Network Programming. My programming experience dates back to my junior year of high school.
      After high school I studied for two years at the Santa Rosa Junior College where I learned to balance my schoolwork with Swimming for the SRJC swim team. At the SRJC I learned to manage my time and meet deadlines under pressure. At UC Santa
      Cruz I have taken many relevant engineering classes including System programming, Abstract data types, linear algebra, Intro to Software Engineering, Intro to Network programming & Network programming, differential equations and Operating
      System. My Senior Capstone project involved using Scrum management techniques while redesigning the locks for the Baskin School of Engineering. The goal was to make a cloud based lock system. I implemented the backend using Google Cloud. I
      also designed a website and made an android application to write the ID to the sensor and communicate using HTTP calls to the google app engine. I would be a great fit for Coursera due to my ability to collaborate with coworkers and would
      enjoy the opportunity to learn new ways to handle challenging situations and experiences.
